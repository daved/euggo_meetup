- Carefully and fully utilize infrastructure
- Minimize development and maintenance time
- Encourage testing, benchmarking, and documentation
- Simplify cross-platform development

: To be clear, dev time can be slightly longer than avg, but maint is often far lower.
: Aside from an overall lower time cost, optimization is usually less necessary.

- Lightweight, low(ish)-level
- Strongly, statically typed; Compiled w/GC
- Object-oriented-like
- Concurrent; Parallel

: Low-level, but non-deterministic.
: OO-like in that Go does not have type classes; Composition only, no inheritance.
: Parallelism when resources permit; Serialized concurrency otherwise.

: make channel of strings ...
: using the colon/equals assignment operator which declares and initializes a variable
: a concurrent goroutine is ran that sends "eugene" into the channel after sleeping
: "hello" is printed while the goroutine is waiting at the sleep function
: the channel is received from and the received value is printed

* You're Invited!
